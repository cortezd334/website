            <h1>Hi, I'm Danira Cortez</h1>
            <p>I grew up in Las Vegas, hopped around a few cities, and now live in Seattle, where I'm currently looking for opportunities as a Software Engineer. </p>
            <p>I'm a recent graduate from the immersive Software Engineering program at Flatiron School.  I love to learn, whether it be from conversations with others, the books I read, exploring a new country, or in an intense boot camp! My curiosity ransition from flight attendant</p>
            <p>I love to travel and am a bit of an adrenaline seeker! </p>
            {/* <p>Learning to code was a way to challenge myself in an area that I had never explored but had always been intrigued by.</p> */}
