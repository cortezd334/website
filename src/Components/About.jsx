            <div className='about'>
                <p>I'm a flight attendant turned Software Engineer.</p>
                <p>I love traveling the world, meeting new people, exploring different cultures, and taking advantage of each opportunity to learn something new. This desire to learn and grow, whether it be from conversations with others or the books I read, has led me to where I am today! Covid-19 affected the travel industry tremendously and I knew that I couldn't wait to see what would happen. I decided to take a hold of my future and invest in myself by enrolling in Flatiron School's Immersive Software Engineering program. I was flooded with information, languages, frameworks, and worked through all of it, becoming more and more empowered each day. I went from never coding in my life to making multiple web applications in 5 months! Through this process I fell in love with the way I can take an idea and make it a reality.</p>
                <p>I now seek to combine over 15 years of experience in customer service with my newly acquired skills in a Software Engineer role that is either remote or in the Seattle area. Throughout the years I've been lucky enough to work with a wide variety of people, from many different backgrounds, and look forward to working in an inclusive environment that spreads throughout different departments. My years as a flight attendant have not only taught me to maintain composure in emergency situations, but to respond quickly and accurately while communicating clearly with the correct personnel. This has led me to easily adapt and thrive in new environments.</p>
                <p>When I'm not trying to solve a bug or exploring a new country, you can find me FaceTiming my family, trying a new restaurant, reading a book, hiking, or working out. I'm also a bit of a thrill seeker so it is possible to see me jump out of a plane or under the sea, as I am PADI certified!</p>
